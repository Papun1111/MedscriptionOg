## Project Overview

The Advanced Healthcare Management Platform is a sophisticated web-based solution aimed at transforming the healthcare service model. This platform simplifies patient management, optimizes appointment scheduling, and improves the overall interaction between patients and healthcare providers through a suite of digital tools and dashboards.

---

## Problem Statement

The healthcare industry faces significant challenges with patient management and appointment scheduling:
- **Prolonged Waiting Times:** Inefficient scheduling leads to long waiting periods for patients.
- **Increased Patient Dissatisfaction:** Traditional, error-prone scheduling methods diminish patient experience.
- **Excessive Administrative Overhead:** In-person interactions and phone calls are time-consuming and labor-intensive.

These issues highlight the urgent need for a digital solution that can streamline scheduling, reduce administrative work, and enhance doctor-patient interactions.

---

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a comprehensive healthcare management website that facilitates seamless interactions between patients and healthcare providers. Key functionalities include:
- **Online Appointment Booking:** A user-friendly interface that reduces waiting times.
- **Payment Processing:** Secure integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe and Razorpay).
- **Customer Service Chatbot:** An AI-powered chatbot to assist users in real time.
- **Specialized Dashboards:**
  - **Owner Dashboard:** For managing doctor profiles and overseeing system activities.
  - **Doctor Dashboard:** Provides detailed insights into patient appointments, payment statuses, and queries.

---

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main components:

- **Backend:**  
  Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (via Mongoose), the backend handles API requests, authentication, payment processing, and file uploads.

- **Frontend:**  
  Developed using React and Vite, this component is the primary client-side application for patients and healthcare providers.

- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  Also built with React and Vite, this dashboard allows administrators to manage doctor profiles and oversee platform operations.

---

## Features

- **Patient Management:** Efficient registration and management of patient data.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** A robust system that minimizes delays and administrative tasks.
- **Payment Processing:** Secure transactions integrated with multiple payment gateways.
- **Doctor Dashboard:** In-depth insights into appointments, payments, and user queries.
- **Owner Dashboard:** Tools for managing doctor profiles and monitoring platform performance.
- **Customer Service Chatbot:** Real-time support to assist users with their inquiries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (for the backend database)
- (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setting Up the Backend

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the required variables. For example:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
   RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```

5. **Start the Backend Server (Development Mode):**

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Setting Up the Admin Dashboard

1. **Navigate to the Admin Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../admin
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Admin Dashboard (Development Mode):**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment

### Deploying the Backend

1. **Prepare Environment Variables:**  
   Ensure that your `.env` file is configured with production values.

2. **Deploy the Server:**  
   Choose your preferred hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) and deploy your backend.

3. **Start the Server in Production Mode:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Deploying the Frontend and Admin

1. **Build the Projects:**  
   For both the frontend and admin components, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the Build:**  
   Deploy the generated static files to a static hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

3. **Preview the Production Build Locally (Optional):**

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
